🚆 TrainBookingSoftware - Your Console-Based Railway Reservation Companion

**TrainBookingSoftware** is a simple, menu-driven Java application that simulates a railway ticket booking system via the command line. Designed for basic learning, it allows users to book and cancel tickets, view available seats, and manage train reservations effectively—all within a console interface.

Built with Java and designed to run seamlessly in any Eclipse environment, this project serves as a great introduction to object-oriented programming, file handling, and console interaction in Java.
